            <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<h4><b>
			News: The program is ready now.</b></h4>
			<h4><b>
			News: We are honored to announce that Prof. Frank Klassner from Villanova University and Prof. Jinqiu Yang from Concordia University will give keynote presentations in our workshop!!!</b></h4>
		    <h4><b>News: We are now collaborating with Springer ASE Journal and selected papers from our workshop can be extended for <a href="https://ause-journal.github.io/24varse.html"> a special issue on VARSE at ASE Journal </a></b></h4>
			<h4>This workshop aims to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing in the areas of virtual and augmented reality and software engineering, as well as to nurture a research community. VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) are emerging techniques with promising applications. Major IT companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple all have essential investment in the area, and Facebook even have changed its name to Meta to focus on metaverse, a concept technically largely depends on virtual reality. As VR/AR platforms such as Unity, Google ARCore, Apple ARKit, and Meta for Developers are getting more and more popular, thousands of apps have been developed to explore various VR/AR applications such as gaming, education, remote communication, computer-aided operation, etc. VR/AR software development has a lot of special concerns, such as graphics design and performance optimization, management of 3D assets, testing constraints in physical world (for AR apps), and additional privacy protection (e.g., tackling leak of head and body movement information from VR/AR devices). Meanwhile, VR/AR can be adopted as an important technique to support software engineering practices that are not possible in traditional 2D interfaces. For example, 3D visualization of code and project work space may largely enhance software productivity. 		
			
			In this workshop, we call for talks and papers from both industry and academia to mutually advance the state of the art and practice in this area, and we expect the workshop to serve as a platform for the industry side to introduce the problems and challenges they face, as well as for the academia side to introduce their solutions and findings to the industry for broader impact. </h4>

            <li>14:50-15:30 Keynote: Beyond Accuracy: Engineering Trustworthy AI Software Systems
			<br>Jinqiu Yang, Concordia University
			<br><font size="-1"><b>Abstract:</b>As AI models become deeply embedded in life-critical applications such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and cybersecurity, success can no longer be defined by accuracy metrics alone. The real-world deployment of these AI software systems presents complex engineering challenges, where robustness and fairness are critical to the safe deployment of these life-critical systems. In this keynote, I will illustrate these challenges and present our solutions to ensure the engineering of trustworthy ML systems. First, I will introduce the safety and robustness challenges of autonomous driving systems (ADS), and discuss our recent works on evaluating and improving the robustness and efficiency of ADS. In particular, we address the significant performance challenge in ADS, such as that of a real-time system. Next, I will discuss our recent efforts to build trustworthy AI systems (fairness, transparency, and accountability), beyond ADS, including coding agents and robotics. Last, I will draw parallels between autonomous driving systems and emerging agentic AI systems, highlighting their shared engineering principles and the ongoing challenges in ensuring reliability, safety, and alignment in agentic systems.</font>
			<br><font size="-1"><b>Bio:</b>Dr. Jinqiu Yang is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University, where she leads the O-RISA Lab on reliable and trustworthy AI-powered software systems.
