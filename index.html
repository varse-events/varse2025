			<h4><b>
			News: The program is ready now.</b></h4>

			<h4><b>
			News: We are honored to announce that Dr. Xueling Zhang from Rochester Institute of Technology will give a keynote presentation in our workshop!!!<a href="https://xuelingz.github.io/">
			Xueling Zhang</a> is well known for her pioneer research work on the testing of AR and VR applications.</b></h4>
			<h4><b>News: The deadline is extended to Aug 17, 2024. The new deadline is firm.</b><h4>
		        <h4><b>News: We are now collaborating with Springer ASE Journal and selected papers from our workshop can be extended for <a href="https://ause-journal.github.io/24varse.html"> a special issue on VARSE at ASE Journal </a></b></h4>
--->			
			<h4>This workshop aims to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing in the areas of virtual and augmented reality and software engineering, as well as to nurture a research community. VR (Virtual Reality) and AR (Augmented Reality) are emerging techniques with promising applications. Major IT companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Apple all have essential investment in the area, and Facebook even have changed its name to Meta to focus on metaverse, a concept technically largely depends on virtual reality. As VR/AR platforms such as Unity, Google ARCore, Apple ARKit, and Meta for Developers are getting more and more popular, thousands of apps have been developed to explore various VR/AR applications such as gaming, education, remote communication, computer-aided operation, etc. VR/AR software development has a lot of special concerns, such as graphics design and performance optimization, management of 3D assets, testing constraints in physical world (for AR apps), and additional privacy protection (e.g., tackling leak of head and body movement information from VR/AR devices). Meanwhile, VR/AR can be adopted as an important technique to support software engineering practices that are not possible in traditional 2D interfaces. For example, 3D visualization of code and project work space may largely enhance software productivity. 
			
			
			In this workshop, we call for talks and papers from both industry and academia to mutually advance the state of the art and practice in this area, and we expect the workshop to serve as a platform for the industry side to introduce the problems and challenges they face, as well as for the academia side to introduce their solutions and findings to the industry for broader impact. </h4>

            <p>
			Submissions must conform to the ASE 2025 formatting and submission instructions:
                All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the 
		    <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines</a> 
		    LaTEX users must use the \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEETran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf option.
            The page limit of the submission is <b>five</b> pages with one additional page for references.
            </p>
            <p>
            All the submissions must not have been published elsewhere or under review elsewhere when being
            considered for VARSE 2025.

            Similar to ASE, VARSE will employ a double-blind review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Please submit your papers through the following EasyChair link: </p>

            <p>
                For accepted papers (except for talk abstracts), authors are required to prepare their final submissions for the workshop proceedings based on the suggestions provided by reviewers, and one author is expected to attend the workshop and present the paper.
            </p>

			<li>9:10-10:00 Keynote: Testing of Augmented Reality Software: Challenges and Opportunities
			<br>Xueling Zhang, Rochester Institute of Technology
			<br><font size="-1"><b>Abstract:</b>Augmented Reality (AR) is an emerging technique that blends virtual objects into real-world scenes to provide revolutionary user experience in tasks such as education, navigation, virtual meetings, gaming, etc. Due to AR applications' in-depth interaction with the physical world and manual operations, their quality is more important than traditional software because flaws in them are more likely to cause immediate human safety threats and even disasters. However, the testing of AR applications can be very challenging because part of their context and input (i.e., the real-world scenes) cannot be easily controlled and a proper testing environment often requires tremendous manual effort to prepare. In this presentation, I will introduce the most recent research efforts from my lab to address these problems and the challenges we face. </font>
